December was one of the original months in the ancient Roman calendar, which was in use from around 750 BC until 45 BC. In this original Roman calendar, December was actually the tenth month. This placement actually makes a lot more sense for December, as this month’s name translates into “tenth month.” When Julius Caesar changed the calendar in 45 BC to the Julian calendar, he added two months, January and February, which were inserted at the beginning of the calendar year. These changes have forever cursed December to be a month with the wrong name.
