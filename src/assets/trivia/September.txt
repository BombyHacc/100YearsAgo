September’s name is really quite inaccurate these days. It was originally the seventh month of the ancient Roman calendar, and as such is was named Septem, which translates into “the seventh month”. It wasn’t until 451 BC that the months of January and February were added to the calendar, making September the ninth month.

September also used to only have 29 days. Thanks to Julius Caesar’s reform of the Roman calendar in 46 BC the month now has an additional day!

The Romans would quite often associate different months with different gods. The month of September is associated with Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, quite possibly because it was a fiery hot month back when it was the seventh month of the year.

In the year 1752, the British Empire skipped 11 days of September, between the 2nd and 14th. This was actually due to another calendar change, although this time it was when the British Empire changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar.

Back in the days of the Anglo-Saxons September used to be called Gerst Monath, which translates into “barley month”. It was given this name because it was the time of year that the barley crop was harvested, and it was a special time as they brewed a popular drink out of it.

The Anglo-Saxons had another name for September too, which was Haefest Monath. This is a particularly interesting one as this translates into harvest month, and our modern-day usage of the word harvest originates from this name!

September 11, 2001, changed the shape of the world forever. It was on this fateful day that the worst terrorist attack on US soil happened when four commercial airliners were hijacked. Two of the planes were flown straight into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, and another was crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth plane crash-landed into a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers of the flight attempted to regain control of the plane from the terrorists.

September 17th is an incredibly important day for the US, as it was on this day in 1787 that the US Constitution was adopted. If it weren’t for the Constitution the US could be an incredibly different country today, with far fewer civil liberties!

September is graced with having two different birth flowers. The two flowers are the vibrant aster and the beautiful yet resilient morning glory. The significance of both flowers is actually very similar, with the aster being said to represent love, while the morning glory represents affection.

September only has one birthstone though, but with a stone like this, who needs another? The stone I’m talking about is the majestically vivid sapphire.

Libras, on the other hand, value harmony and diplomacy, and are said to be both intelligent and kind.
